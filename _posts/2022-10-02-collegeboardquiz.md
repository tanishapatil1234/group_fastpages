### Updates *
I didn't have trouble with any specific problem but I found this one to be a little challenging to understand at first: 
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q3.png "https://tanishapatil1234.github.io/test-fastpage-tp/")
- I have a better understanding of this problem now that I have gone over it but to summarize: 
- It returns a copy of numList with j and k switched. Both J and K need to be between 1 and the length of numList (inclusive). The code makes a copy of numList and names it newList. Then the element at newList(j) is switched and instead assigned the element at numList(k). The code only works if j and k are valid within both lists so j and k must be between 1 and the length of the list
- At first I didn't understand the paramaters j and k had to satisy but it makes more sense after reviewing it
