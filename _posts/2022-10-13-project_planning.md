## Row 2: Data Abstraction
Data about song and artists stored in dictionary which is retrieved using API
## Row 3: Managing Complexity
- use a function to read user input and only provide wanted album information
- allowing user to use favorites tab to organize the artists they enjoy
## Row 4: Procedural Abstraction
- using artist[album], retrieve only wanted data from the dictionary. call developed function to run based on user input.
## Row 5: Algorithm Implementation
- develop algorithim to count number of songs in album given API data
- algorithm to create 'favorite artists' tab, where users - can select their favorite artists to be saved in a seperate section of the application
